## Welcome to the project page of "A Long-Short-Term Mixed-Integer Formulation for Highway Motion Planning"

This work is related to an IEEE journal submission by Rudolf Reiter, Armin Nurkanovic, Daniele Bernardini, Moritz Diehl and Alberto Bemporad.

An approach is presented for safe trajectory planning, where a strategic task related to autonomous racing is learned within a simulation environment. The following videos show evaluations of the trained HILEPP-II policy in different scenarios related to autonomous racing tasks. Opponent vehicles are simualted with an obstacle avoiding MPC formulations for autonomous racing, which not explicitly considers strategic driving (PPP)

## Scenario 1:
The ego vehilce starts first and has to block three stronger opponents. "Stronger" relates to parameters such as vehicle mass, accelerations limits and available braking force.
